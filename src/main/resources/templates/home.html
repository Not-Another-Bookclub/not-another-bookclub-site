            Not Another Book Club (N.A.B.) seeks to connect people with each by making new friends or maintaining friendships through books.

            <br>

            It is, at its most basic level, a social-network for bibliophiles.
        </p>

        <p>
            With N.A.B all the bookworms of the world can enjoy their pastime at any location.

            <br>

            There’s some days that traveling to the designated venue to enjoy another group book session is not possible.
