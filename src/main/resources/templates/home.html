The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”</p>

            Not Another Book Club (N.A.B.) seeks to connect people with each by making new friends or maintaining friendships through books.

            <br>

            It is, at its most basic level, a social-network for bibliophiles.
        </p>

        <p>
            With N.A.B all the bookworms of the world can enjoy their pastime at any location.

            <br>

            There’s some days that traveling to the designated venue to enjoy another group book session is not possible.
