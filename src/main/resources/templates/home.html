    <h1>Welcome to Not Another BookClub</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
        Not Another Book Club (N.A.B.) seeks to connect people with each by making new friends or maintaining friendships through books.
        <br>
        It is, at its most basic level, a social-network for bibliophiles.
    </p>

    <p>
        With N.A.B all the bookworms of the world can enjoy their pastime at any location. Thereâ€™s some days that traveling to the designated venue to enjoy another group book session is not possible.
    </p>

<h1>Eventually there will be other stuff here</h1>
